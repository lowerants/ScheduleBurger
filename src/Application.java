    The controller class creates the list of model objects, both the ArrayList and its members.
    The controller class creates and shows an instance of the view class. The view class should include JTextFields to display data accessed from the model objects.
    When the view class is first shown, it should display data from the object in the first position of the ArrayList.
    The view class should include the following buttons:
        Previous - to move backwards
        Next - to move forwards through the objects in the ArrayList
        Add - add a new object to the list
        Update - make changes to an existing object
        Delete - remove the current object
        Quit - exit the application (hint: you can use System.exit(0); )
    All of the behavior above should be mediated by the controller class. In other words, the view class should only communicate with the controller, and the controller alone manages interactions with the model objects.
