HashMap<Course, CourseStatus>
encapsulated in the class CourseProgress (nested class in Student)

Stores the Studentâ€™s current progress for each of their Courses (currently taking, not passed, failed. etc.)

HashMaps have O(1) search and add (put), but no order.
There is no ordering required, so the lack of order does not matter, making search and add the most important functions.
HashMaps do not allow two of the same key, which is okay because a Student can only have 1 status of a course at a time (ie currently taking, passed, failed, etc.) HashMaps allow the same key to be used, which is good because multiple Courses can have the same status
